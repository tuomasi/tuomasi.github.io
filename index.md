# Hi there

Nice that you are here! I'm Thomas, and I mostly just try to become who I am by letting go of who I used to be. I'm based in [Hof](https://goo.gl/maps/5UgNSKhkgFLKCNQb9) with my wife and two children. I currently work as a senior software engineer with [HipSquare](https://www.hipsquare.net/en). In the past, I was one of the co-founders of [Elohna](https://squeng.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/bexit/).

Do [say hi](mailto:brunner.thom@gmail.com) (it would mean a lot!).
