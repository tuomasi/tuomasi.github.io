### Resurrecting this website

I am currently working on bringing this website back to life. While much (most likely too much) of the work happens inside my head, I try to make a habit of actually putting some of my thoughts into action. No more empty promises to myself. I rather write non-sense than not write at all. I might also play around with different designs, but most likely will stick with the current solution as it's simple and efficient, and because I'm finally desperate enough to spend all my available time producing something rather than playing around.

### Dostoyevsky - The Idiot

Sometimes you know you are going to like a book or an author before reading any of his works. For me, Dostoyevsky is one such author. I am currently reading his The Idiot as part of my journey through the Russian classics (Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Bulgakov), and cannot help but be amazed by his understanding and knowledge of the human condition. It's almost uncomfortably deep and vast. No wonder Nietzsche said that Dostoyevsky was the only psychologist from whom he learned something. It's a book that you will not regret reading, and I dare say you might end up learning something about yourself.

### Woodworking

So far I mostly worked with wood out of necessity, though I always thoroughly enjoyed it. My first actual hobby project worth mentioning was a tabletop that I made from 3cm thick hardwood. I realised some time ago that I need more desk surface area, and particularly more depth. So I got a 5mx30cmx3cm slice of tree, cut it into three pieces and put them together in such a way that the tree bark would remain on the long edges of the table. It's far from perfect, but I learned a lot (as a beginner one can learn a lot even from seemingly simple projects), and I like the fact that it's alive in that it's finished (I've been using it for a month now) but also a work-in-progress (the way I put together the three boards was too weak so that the gaps between them are widening). More importantly, it solved the problem it was meant to and I really like it :)
