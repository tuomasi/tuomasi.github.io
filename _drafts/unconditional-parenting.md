Becoming a parent is a funny thing. You know it's coming, and yet you have no idea what's coming for you.

Being a parent is, of course, what we really mean when talking about parenthood. It's something that comes with the ultimate responsibility, and yet many to-be or freshly baked parents don't really prepare for it. Heck, some people never have the need to question their approach to parenting at all. I assume the logic is something like "I have more or less successfully lived my own life for x years, surely I will be able to be a good enough role model to equip my child with whatever it needs to live a happy life. Also, they don't make people take exams on how to be a parent before actually being one - how hard can it be then?".

The outcome is simple: The less you actively think about and question your role as a parent and your parenting style, the more you will make your child experience a childhood similar to yours - i.e. the more you will be like your own parents. Now, depending on your parents, that might be a very good thing, but better to not leave things to chance.

One topic that I read about is 'unconditional parenting', which I would transcribe as 'unconditionally loving your child'.
