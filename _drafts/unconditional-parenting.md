Becoming a parent is a funny thing. You know it's coming, and yet you cannot really prepare for it. Heck, some people never have the need to question their approach to parenting at all. I assume the logic is something like "I have more or less successfully lived my own life for x years, surely I will be able to provide enough support for my child to be able"
