<p>Craic is a simple social network and microblogging platform much like Twitter. You can create an account, befriend/follow other users, write short posts as well as like, share and answer to other users' posts.</p>

<p>The backend of the application was realised using MongoDB and Node.js, whereas the frontend used classic HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
