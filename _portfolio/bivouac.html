<p>Bivouac is a project management tool much like Trello. Throughout my MSc in St Andrews, this was the first project which had us do something really useful/cool (granted, us freshlings couldn't do much in the first semester since we were busy learning the basics of it all).</p>

<p>The project makes use of the Google Drive API and the Google Drive Realtime API, primarily to store projects and allow collaboration.</p>
