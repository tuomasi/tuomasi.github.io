<p>KivaStats is a data mashup and visualisation single page web app. The app retrieves the latest data from kiva via their API and provides the users with several visualisations of the data, including simple tables, line charts, bar charts and a world map. It also retrieves data from the World Bank and provides a comparison between World Bank and kiva financial dynamics.</p>

<p>The backend of the application was realised using MongoDB and Node.js. The frontend uses D3.js and the Google Charts API to create the above mentioned visualisations.</p>
