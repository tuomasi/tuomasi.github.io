<p>TIRAna stands for "Twitter Interactive Realtime Analysis" and is the artefact and key delivery of my MSc dissertation, which was entitled "Interactive Realtime Analysis of Social Media Data". In a nutshell, the app allows you to retrieve real-time Twitter data (around 1% of either the sample stream, which is a random set of tweets, or the filter stream, which only gives you tweets matching the keyword(s) provided by you) and analyse the incoming data by means of various visualisations.</p>

<p>Technoloy-wise, the building blocks of the app are Node.JS, MongoDB, the Twitter Streaming API, Socket.IO and D3.js. In addition, tools like the npm async or twit modules as well as passport.js, amongst others, made for a smoother (read: faster) development.</p>

<p>Probably the coolest thing about this particular project was to see how much Twitter data reflects real-world events, and how it gives you a thorough understanding of the general public's opinion on any given matter. Since developing the app was the only thing I did for days, the app itself often functioned as a means of staying up-to-date (often even ahead of global news sites) with current events. Just by looking at the top 10 hashtags, for instance, one could get a good idea of what's currently trending.</p>
