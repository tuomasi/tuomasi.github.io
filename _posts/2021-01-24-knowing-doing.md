There is a huge difference between merely performing a certain action and being a person who knows why he is performing that action.

Think back to when you did something that you now regret. Instead of saying "I should not have done X" it would be far more wise to say "I wish I had been a person who would not contemplate X in the first place".

When trying to get better at something, don't just copy what masters of the craft in question do, try to understand why they do the things they do.

The same logic applies when teaching someone something: Don't just tell them what to do - tell them why they should do it.

So:

-   Be aware of your actions.
-   Be aware of your thoughts, emotions and feelings (Exercising mindfulness and meditating helps).
-   Ask questions (dig deep!).
-   Don't do anything unless you know why you're doing it.

It's common sense, but it bears repeating.
