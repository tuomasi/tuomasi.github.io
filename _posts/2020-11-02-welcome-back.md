So I finally got around to unearth this old fossil of a personal website and am now trying to breathe some fresh life into it.

Shortly after I had set up the old version of this web site, I co-founded a company and was solely focused on that. Looking back, it might have proven helpful and useful both to me and others if I _had_ written about that particular journey (I will write about my experiences back then though, so not all is lost).

Another reason the old site was idle after the first post was that I simply didn't know what to write about. I didn't think my thoughts or experiences interesting enough to share them with others, let alone people I don't know. Whenever I thought of writing about something, the first question that came to my mind was "Is anybody going to like this?", and with it came the pressure and with that, all creative momentum was fading away. I realise now that I had my priorities mixed up. Writing is nothing else than expressing one's thoughts, so the only guiding question I will ask myself from now on is: "Is this conveying my thoughts adequately?". Whether you like it or not is entirely up to you :)
