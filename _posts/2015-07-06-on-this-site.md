Okay so this is really my first post here. Welcome you all!

First of all, to those of you who have been here before, I must apologise for having taken so long to actually publish something and indeed to bring this site up to shape. I'll spare you with any excuses. Instead, I thought it wise to outline why I created this site in the first place.

##This site's purpose

The purpose of this site is, essentially, three-fold:

1. **Learning**

	Although I have been using (read: consuming) technologies ever since I was a kid, I am still fairly new to using technologies to actually create something on my own. Consequently, there is still a sea of things for me to discover, and we all know that the best learning is applied learning. This site is the perfect playground for me to expand my knowledge on web technologies (primarily frontend), UI, UX, blogging and writing itself.

2. **Sharing**

	At the same time I intend to share, next to information about myself in the form of a CV or portfolio, my experiences and thoughts on all those things I deem worth sharing. This might include life lessons, travel reports or general ideas and questions.

3. **Connect**

	Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, I would be happy if you find the time to contact me. After all, I believe it is the interaction with others that makes us human beings and that allows us to gain the most valuable insights.

Enjoy your stay and have a good day!
